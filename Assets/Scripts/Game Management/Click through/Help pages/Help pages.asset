  - title: 'How to play: Moving Around'
    text: Use WASD or the arrow keys to move. Up accelerates you, and makes you fly
      farther into space, while down slows you and makes you fall inwards. Left and
      right are useful for course changes when not in a tight orbit.
  - title: 'How to play: Fuel'
    text: You only have so much fuel, so use it carefully! If you run out you'll
      have no choice but to drift through space.
  - title: 'How to play: Collisions'
    text: If objects in space collide, due to the high speeds they'll usually explode.
      This includes your spaceship!
  - title: 'How to play: The Flag'
    text: The goal of the game is to maneuver until you hit the flag. Once you do,
      the game will end and you'll recieve points depending on how well you did.
  - title: 'How to play: Orbs'
    text: The little blue things are orbs - collect them for extra points!
